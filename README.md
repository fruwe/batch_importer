class Currency < ApplicationRecord
  class ImportableModel < CSVStepImporter::Model::ImportableModel
    # The model to be updated
    def model_class
      ::Currency
    end

    def columns
      [:code, :name, :created_at, :updated_at]
    end

    def on_duplicate_key_update
      [:name, :updated_at]
    end
  end
